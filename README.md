# DLC_tremor_assessments
Tremor assessment from a video
I have taken a video of hand of a dystonic tremor patient. The video was taken using standard video camera. No special marker were used. Just to fescilitate the annotation/ 
I have put some marks on patient's hand using a marker pen. I have analysed the video using DeepLabCut software and obtained .csv files comprising the coorinates of the
annotated points in every frames. The Matlab program was written to see if the thumb and index fingers are in phase/ out of phase. It also helped us visualising the tremor
frequency in time and frequency domain.
